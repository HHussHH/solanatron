                Meet the mirror meme-tokens TWHALE
                on the Tron and SWHALE on the Solana.
                When you buy TWHALE on SunSwap there is an automatic sale of SWHALE on Radium.
                And vice versa, When you buy SWHALE on Radium there is an automatic sale of TWHALE on SunSwap.
